rust stuff:
  . when going for multi-threading, dont do stuff similar to what is done in fracGen/mandlebrot
    . some areas of the picture will be like sky, ground, so they take less time. this wastes cores
    . instead try y % cores or something thats kinda evenly distributed
  . multiple samples if material is lambertian ????
  . implement the 3d matrix rotations stuff

remember:
  . try using any image for backgroundPix()
  . try reflections from inside a big sphere

plan:
  . using a struct for vectors instead of forcing them in matrices gives a speed boost
