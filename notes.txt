rust stuff:
  /. ram probs due to multi-core stuff
    /. this isnt too much of a problem as the size is max 8*5k*5k*(1*8 f64) bytes -> 1.5 GB or *= 3/8 for (3*1 u8)
  . multiple samples if material is lambertian ????
  . multi-colored materials (all types?)
    . this will look cool on random objects (like the velvet coats or whatever)
    . color as a function of direction of normal (like that of sky)
    . color as func of angle with normal?
  /. lit objects
    /. colored lighting
  . more materials
    . is sub-surface scatterng doable for me?
  . custom images for colors of materials
    . custom skybox
  . fog
  . implement the 3d matrix rotations stuff
    . maybe the current stuff is plenty for this

remember:
  . try reflections from inside a big sphere
