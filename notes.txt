rust stuff:
  /. when going for multi-threading, dont do stuff similar to what is done in fracGen/mandlebrot
    /. some areas of the picture will be like sky, ground, so they take less time. this wastes cores
    /. instead try y % cores or something thats kinda evenly distributed
    /. maybe split work by samples_per_pixel % cores
      /. this needs more ram cuz seperate full size buffer for each core
        /. this isnt too much of a problem as the size is max 8*5k*5k*(1*8 f64) bytes -> 1.5 GB or *= 3/8 for (3*1 u8)
      /. make the world capatible with multiple cores
        /. it already is (i think)
  . multiple samples if material is lambertian ????
  . multi-colored materials (all types?)
    . this will look cool on random objects (like the velvet coats or whatever)
    . color as a function of direction of normal (like that of sky)
    . color as func of angle with normal?
  . lit objects
    . colored lighting
  . more materials
  . custom images for colors of materials
    . custom skybox
  . fog
  . implement the 3d matrix rotations stuff
    . maybe the current stuff is plenty for this

remember:
  . try reflections from inside a big sphere
