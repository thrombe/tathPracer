1. for parallelisation
  . 15 something go routines in a infinite loop waiting on chan and quitchan
  . a goroutine keeps sending pixel{} into chan
    . pixel has x, y, colors, ...
  . goroutines fill the colors in pixel{}
  . then image gets rendered if all goes well
    . maybe render and dump image even if it crashes (helps with debugging)


remember:
  . try using any image for backgroundPix()
  . try reflections from inside a big sphere

plan:
  . using a struct for vectors instead of forcing them in matrices gives a speed boost
